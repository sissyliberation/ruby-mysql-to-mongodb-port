Some code work, having to migrate mysql database to mongodb, and fixing relational-to-one-to-one issues.

1. [gem install mysql](https://rubygems.org/gems/mysql).
1. [gem install mongo](http://rubygems.org/gems/mongo).

Some code that I wrote to migrate MySQL database to MongoDB collection. 

Since relational databases can't be ported to MongoDB one-to-one, there's some code that fixes the relational issues.
